# Problem Solving Approach

### What Is An Algorithm?

A process or a set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

### Problem Solving

- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor

#### Understand The Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? in other words, do I have enough
   information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this quesstion until
   you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering
   the question at this early stage.)
5. How should I label the import pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

#### Simplify

1. Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
3. Write a simplified solution
4. Then incorporate that difficulty back in

#### Refactoring Questions

1. Can you check the result?
2. Can you derive the result differently?
3. Can you understand it at a glance?
4. Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
7. How have other people solved this problem?
