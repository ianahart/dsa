### Some Patterns...

- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Many More!

#### Frequency Counter Pattern

This pattern uses objects or set to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings

#### Multiple Pointers

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning,
end or middle based ona certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minmal space complexity as well.
